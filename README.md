# Final-Project-Algorithms-and-Programs
## Party planner
The program comprises a total of eight classes plus an executable, in which the functionality of the Fiesta class is tested but is not included in the final functionality of the program. The basic classes of the program are Person and Waiter, which are included in an array and a matrix whose attribute is the Fiesta class. In the Fiesta class, the Generic Array Handler class is used to add and remove a waiter, and the Generic Matrix Handler class is used to identify the largest one at the table. Finally, the Fiesta View class was created, which along with the Fiesta View Controller class and the Fiesta View Executable class, generates a functional graphical interface that solves the problem.
